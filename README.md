# Welcome to Maple Flavor!

## Introduction
Maple Flavor is a WeChat app aiming to promote healthy diets in campus as well as communication between students and cafeteria. Students and teachers can learn about the newest dishes, bookmark their favorites, and write reviews to dishes. The cafeteria manager can promote new food and activities, conduct online survey, and get feedback from students.


## How to use

### Common Functions
A normal user should first login in and give permission for the program to use basic WeChat account information such as username and avatar URL.

#### Discovery:
Users are able to check the newest activities and dishes on this page. The page mainly contains a swiper (which shows pictures of activities) and a list of newest foods. Users can click on any food item to see details of the dish.



#### New1:
This is the page that shows details for a specific dish. Users can see all information about the dish, add bookmarks, leave comments, and share dishes with others in Wechat. 


#### DishList:
This is where people can see every dish provided by cafeteria based on different categories. Users can view all possible choices conveniently before ordering food in the cafeteria.


#### Mine:
This is the page that shows users' account information. It also enables users to check bookmarked dishes, get help, and learn about the creators of the Maple Flavor project. The rest of the page will display differently based on users' identity (either normal user or manager). 

##### For Normal User
The Mine page will display a form where users can give suggestions to help us better improve the project. Comments will be reviewed by project managers regularly.


##### Manager
The Mine page will display mainly three blocks where managers can search dishes, add new dishes, and upload swiper posters to the WeChat Cloud database. We will also add more features like modify and delete to the manager page during this summer holiday.
